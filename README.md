# Skin Cancer Detection

This repository contains a web application for detecting skin cancer using a deep learning model. The application allows users to upload an image of a skin lesion and receive a prediction on whether the lesion is benign or malignant.

## Live URL

The application is currently live at [anilenambiar.com](http://anilenambiar.com).

## Project Structure

- [`app.py`](app.py ): The main Flask application file.
- [`model.py`](model.py ): Contains the function to load the pre-trained model.
- [`Procfile`](Procfile ): Configuration file for deploying the app with Gunicorn.
- [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt ): Lists the dependencies required for the project.
- [`skin_cancer_model_VGG16_v1.h5`](skin_cancer_model_VGG16_v1.h5 ): The pre-trained model file.
- [`static`](static ): Directory for static files like CSS.
- [`templates`](templates ): Directory for HTML templates.
- [`testing.ipynb`](testing.ipynb ): Jupyter notebook for testing the model.
- [`training.ipynb`](training.ipynb ): Jupyter notebook for training the model.
- [`uploads`](uploads ): Directory for storing uploaded images.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/skin-cancer-detection.git
    cd skin-cancer-detection
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the application:
    ```sh
    flask run
    ```

## Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Upload an image of a skin lesion.
3. View the prediction result.

## Model Training

The model is trained using a VGG16 architecture. The training process is documented in the [`training.ipynb`](training.ipynb ) notebook.

## Model Testing

The model is tested using the [`testing.ipynb`](testing.ipynb ) notebook. The notebook includes evaluation metrics such as loss, accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
